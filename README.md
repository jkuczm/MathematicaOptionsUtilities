## Compatibility

This package contains extensive automatic test suite. Package is being tested
with Mathematica versions 8.0, 9.0 and 10.0 on Linux. Since it doesn't contain
any OS specific code it should work with above versions on all operating
systems.

There's also no obvious reason for package not to work on earlier (6.0+)
versions of Mathematica.
